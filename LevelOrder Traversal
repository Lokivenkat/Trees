Task:
A level-order traversal, also known as a breadth-first search, visits each level of a tree's nodes from left to right, top to bottom. You are given a pointer, , pointing to the root of a binary search tree. Complete the levelOrder function provided in your editor so that it prints the level-order traversal of the binary search tree.

Hint: You'll find a queue helpful in completing this challenge.

Function Description:

Complete the levelOrder function in the editor below.

levelOrder has the following parameter:
- Node pointer root: a reference to the root of the tree

Prints
- Print node.data items as space-separated line of integers. No return value is expected.

sol:
   def levelOrder(self,root):
        queue=[]
        queue.append(root)
        while(len(queue)!=0):
            root=queue.pop(0)
            print(root.data,end=" ")
            if(root.left is not None):
                queue.append(root.left)
            if(root.right is not None):
                queue.append(root.right)
